we have learnt that in recursion we get 2 choices of if wewant to include it or not ,we get those choices multiple times in recursion sometimes , so inorder  to avoid computing the recursive callof those same values that we have allready computed , we use dp;
in dp we take an extra storage variable that is a matrix that stores the variables that are changing and then , we would first come up with a recursive solution , then we would make a storage variable and whenever we are getting a recursive call we will store 
the returned value of that function in that matrix and then thst value for those metrics get stored in that area in matrix and whenever agagin that recursive call occurs we can return value that to it instead of computing the whole recursiev call solution again
, for doing this we need to check first in recurisve soln if the matrix has that variable in it ,then we will directly return that varibale from the matrix , if not we will go to further recursibve calls which will again store values in matrix 

we used to do like we take out one input and remove it and then person recurisve call on smaller input right here also we will do that
but there was always diff criteria of removing elements right?, then we would have diff criteria here as well so here we first take the last ellemnt out and make decision for that if we want to include it in knapsack or we dont want ot include it , if the weight of item will be more han knapcak cap we simply dont include it one one choice here
but what would be the base case here base case would be when there is one item or when there is 0 items, 0ites because wetake the least  valid input and least valid input would be 0,so when items are 0, max profit would be 0 only because items are zero here, it cant be -1  right we cant have -1 items , whereas there is one more condition , we have capacity as well right in inpputs so that will also be considered, if cap is 0 then even if we have items , our max profit will be 0 right, here also cap cant be -1 , so we take 0 and not 1 because 0 is smallest valid input
then we make a choice diagram for the lastelelmntwhich we want to remove , we will check if the elelmnt weight is more than knapsack weight , then we would not include the elemnt and the choice has been made so we make recyrsive call to reduced input
but if item weight < cap, then we have 2 choices whether to taek it or not , in firsst choice we take it and in second choice we dont 
so here we have to find the max profit between those 2 choices of including this lemnt and of not including this elelmnt
when we have 1 choice max preofit is that only but when we have 2 choices we have to find the max between whether this choice will bring us nmax profit or this one 
while including we will simply add the val[n-1] that is its price to the reudced recurisve call which will bring us max profit from further n-2 elemnts by including their vals or not including them
that will be added to the first element because here we made a choice right that including this can bring us profit so further thelements will bea dded ot it whichw will be illegible for including 
from the leftover items and them the max of this and where we didnot include this value will be returned and the max of two will be considered as max profit
